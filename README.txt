== Description ==
Adds a dashboard widget displaying your adsense data in the following ranges: TODAY, YESTERDAY, LAST7DAYS, THISMONTH, LASTMONTH and ALLTIME.

**IMPORTANT**

As this is the first release and there is much improvement to be had, I thought that it was ready enough to release to the wild.  However, the display of the plugins is still a big off.  Please only choose to display two timelines at a time.  This will be fixed in future versions.

== Features ==

* Allows you to pick which time line of data that you would like to support
* Displays the information in a widget on the dashboard for easy viewing

= Future Features =

* If all time line ranges are selected, it will be better formatted on the widget
* Better format in general.
* More options to choose and display EXACTLY what you want.  IE:  not displaying "DOMAINS" information and only showing your "Earnings"
* Storing the data in the database and only updating it ever 30 minutes

== Installation ==

Just like any other wordpress plugin:

* Download it.
* Unzip into your wordpress/wp-content/plugins directory
* Active the plugin via your Administrative Interface.
* SEE -> [Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)

Once activated, all  you need to do is enter your google adsense **Username** and **Password** in the settings page.  Wala!  Go to the dashboard to see your stats.
